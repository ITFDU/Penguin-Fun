# Penguin-Fun

This is one of my first project in analytics using Python coding language. The goal of this project was to explore the differences and similarieties of Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins. To complete this goal I used visualizations with Seaborne, analysis with SciPy, and a visual interactive dashboard with Dash.
